**Blood Group Classification via Fingerprints** 🖐️

Welcome to the **Blood Group Classification** project! 🎉 This repository showcases an innovative deep-learning model designed to predict blood groups based on fingerprint patterns. 🧬✨

## 🌟 **Features**
- **Accurate Classification**: Our model predicts 8 blood groups (`A+`, `A-`, `B+`, `B-`, `AB+`, `AB-`, `O+`, `O-`) with high precision. 🩺
- **Interactive Frontend**: Upload a fingerprint image via a sleek and user-friendly web interface. 🌐✨
- **Scalable Deployment**: Easily deployable using Flask for web-based or API-based predictions. 🚀
